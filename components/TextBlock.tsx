        In the past four years, the DeFi sector has witnessed explosive growth,
        accumulating a staggering market cap of 48 billion USD. However, this
        surge has been tainted by significant financial losses for investors,
        largely due to the proliferation of fraudulent projects promising
        unrealistic APR/APY and other investment strategies.

              To counter these vulnerabilities, there's an urgent call for an
              algorithmic solution. Such a solution would play a pivotal role in
              discerning patterns and establishing robust safeguards within the
              DeFi sphere. The demand for a strategic product capable of
              mitigating risks and preventing fraudulent activities in DeFi is
              palpable.
